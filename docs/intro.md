# My Notes

Let's discover **Blog or My Notes**.

## What am I doing here

I am writing my own notes here, from my English notes to my Node.js notes. I will try to keep the notes as short as possible.
They may be useful for you or they may not interest you at all. I hope you find something useful.

## Software Development Notes

These are my notes on various software development topics, including.

### `Javascript`

Javascript is everything. ;)

### `React`

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Components are the building blocks of React applications.
Use React's state and props to manage data and pass it between components.

### `React Native`

React Native is a mobile application development framework that uses React to build native mobile apps.
Components in React Native work similarly to those in React, but are specific to mobile devices.
React Native supports both iOS and Android platforms.

### `SCSS`

SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into CSS.
Use SCSS to write CSS more efficiently and with more flexibility.
SCSS supports variables, mixins, functions, and more.

### `Svelte`

Svelte is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-learn JavaScript framework for building web applications.
Svelte compiles your code into highly optimized JavaScript code, resulting in fast and performant web applications.
Svelte's component-based architecture makes it easy to build modular and reusable components.

### `Vue`

Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
Vue is designed to be flexible and easy to learn, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.
Vue's component-based architecture makes it easy to build reusable and maintainable components.

### `Node.js`

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Node.js allows developers to build scalable, high-performance web applications using JavaScript on both the server and client side.
Node.js has a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools, making it a popular choice for web developers.
I hope these notes are useful to you in your software development journey. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with!
